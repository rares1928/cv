\begin{comment}
I am by no means a professional when it comes to the CV's/resumes, I have
received various trainings on how to write a CV and resume from my high 
school, as well as the Austin College and University of Eastern Finland's
career counseling departments. As I intend to share my CV as a template, I 
feel that it is my responsibility to provide explanations of my work.

%-----FONT OPTIONS-------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{comment}
The font of the document will impact not just how readable it is, but how it is
perceived. In the "The Craft of Scientific Writing" by Michael Alley, shares a
common fonts for publication as well as their use. I have chosen to use
Palatino for its legibility, some others are given below. There is far too much
about typography to discus here. Note: serif fonts have short projecting
strokes, sans-serif fonts are sans (without) these strokes.

\begin{comment}
This CV was written for specifically for positions I was applying for in
academia, and then modified to be a template.

A standard CV is about two pages long where as a resume in the US is one page.
sections can be added and removed here with this in mind. In my experience, 
education, and applicable work experience and skills are the most import things
to include on a resume. For a CV the Europass CV suggests the categories: Work
Experience, Education and Training, Language Skills, Digital Skills,
Communication and Interpersonal Skills, Conferences and Seminars, Creative Works
Driver's License, Hobbies and Interests, Honors and Awards, Management and
Leadership Skills, Networks and Memberships, Organizational Skills, Projects,
Publications, Recommendations, Social and Political Activities, Volunteering.

Your goal is to convey a who, what , when, where, why for every item you share. 
The who is obviously you, but I believe the rest should be done in that order.
For example below. An employer cares most about the degree held and typically 
less about the institution or where it is located (This is still good 
information though). Whatever order you choose be consistent throughout.
